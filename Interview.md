- Android is an open-source mobile operating system developed by Google. It is based on the Linux kernel and designed for touchscreen devices like smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, and wearables. It provides a rich user interface, supports multiple programming languages (Java/Kotlin), and allows developers to create and distribute applications via the Google Play Store.

### Key Features:
- Open-source and customizable
- Supports Java and Kotlin for development
- Uses XML for UI design
- Provides an integrated development environment - (Android Studio)
- Offers built-in security, notifications, and background processing


## 2. What is SDK?
- The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation required to develop, test, and debug Android applications.

### Key Components of SDK:
- SDK Tools â€“ Includes debugging, testing, and - emulator tools.
- Android Emulator â€“ Simulates Android devices on a - computer.
- SDK Platform Tools â€“ Includes ADB (Android Debug - Bridge) for managing devices.
- Build Tools â€“ Converts source code into APK files.
- Android Libraries â€“ Predefined libraries for UI, networking, and storage.


## 3. What are local databases
- A local database in Android is a database stored on the device, allowing apps to store and retrieve data even without an internet connection.

### Common Local Databases in Android:
- SQLite â€“ A lightweight relational database built - into Android.
- Room Database â€“ A wrapper over SQLite that - simplifies database operations.
- SharedPreferences â€“ Used for storing small - key-value data.
- Realm Database â€“ A mobile database designed for high performance.


## 4. Query of crud
- CRUD operations refer to the four basic database operations:

- Create (Insert) â€“ Adds new records to the database.
- Read (Select) â€“ Retrieves records from the database.
- Update â€“ Modifies existing records.
- Delete â€“ Removes records from the database.
