# Introduction to Android Development

## What is Android Development?

Android Development is the process of creating applications for Android devices using programming languages like Java or Kotlin with XML for UI design. It involves designing user interfaces, handling user interactions, managing data, and ensuring smooth performance. Applications run on the Android operating system, which is based on a modified Linux kernel. Developers use Android Studio, the official IDE, to build, test, and deploy Android apps.


## Overview of Android Development

Android development involves creating mobile applications that interact with users through different UI elements. It follows the <b>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</b> architecture and uses various components such as <b>Activities, Fragments, Services, Broadcast Receivers, and Content Providers</b> to build robust applications.

### Key Highlights:
    Languages Used: Java and Kotlin.
    UI Design: XML for layouts.
    IDE: Android Studio.
    App Components: Activities, Fragments, Services, etc.
    Development Framework: Android SDK.
